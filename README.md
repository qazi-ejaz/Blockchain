## What is Blockchain?

**Blockchain** is an open, decentralized distributed ledger which carries out transactions via a peer-to-peer network system. The very first concept was implemented in the form of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) by a genius [**Satoshi Nakamoto**](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper). *Blockchain* is considered the main pillar of the fourth industrial revolution.

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ npm install crypto-js
$ npm init
```

This should result in the creation of ``package.json``


## Inspiration
* [**Udacity**](https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309) is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.
* [**Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence & Computing (PIAIC)**](https://www.piaic.org/block-chain) The mission of this program is to reshape Pakistan by revolutionizing education, research, and business by adopting latest, cutting-edge technologies. Experts are calling this the 4^th industrial revolution. We want Pakistan to become a global hub for AI, data science, cloud native computing, edge computing, blockchain, augmented reality, and internet of things.
