## What is Blockchain?

**Blockchain** is an open, decentralized distributed ledger which carries out transactions via a peer-to-peer network system. The very first concept was implemented in the form of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) by a genius [**Satoshi Nakamoto**](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper). *Blockchain* is considered the main pillar of the fourth industrial revolution.

## How to Use

#### Requirements

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ npm install crypto-js
$ npm init
```

This should result in the creation of ``package.json``
